                A good thing that was I though about my projects with my coworkers. We talked not only about one theme, but
                developed themself across all the web development. I looked at our stack and had disappointment as I wanted to practice typescript and Next js. These tools are must have at frontend sphere.
                I've gone to a big player, lying about my experience. Their teamlead really thought that I am middle. But I couldn't do as middle. As a result, I have been fired. Now I realised my mistakes
                and search a good company can be matched to me.
